# 2023 Data for Good Datathon

This is my code for the data analysis and visualization I completed in the 2023 Data for Good Datathon. In this datathon the objective was to provide valuable isights to Jumpstart Refugee Talent using the database they provided. In specific the insights my team and I worked on through this process were related to GeoSpatial data and and how the origin/desination locations of refugees affect their employability as well as referral,interview and hiring prospects. We uncovered many novel insights related to GeoSpatial data with respect to refugees in Canada, however these insights cannot be shared due to confidentiality. I have also not included the csv file with data as it is confidential information of Jumpstart Refugee Talent.
