# 2023DataforGoodDatathon

This is my code for the data analysis and visualization I completed in the 2023 Data for Good Datathon. In this datathon the object was to provide valuable isights to Jumpstart Refugee Talent using the database they provided. In specific the insights my team and I discovered through this process were related to GeoSpatial data and and how the origin/desination locations of refugees affect their employability as well as referral/interview/hiring prospects. We discovered many novel insights related to GeoSpatial data with respect to refugees in Canada, however these insights cannot be shared due to confidentiality. I have not included the csv file with data as it is confidential information of Jumpstart Refugee Talent.

I utilized Python, Matplotlib, and Pandas in this code in order to manipulate, filter, clean and visualize data.
